// To make a calendar in React, you can follow these steps:

// 1--Start with creating a React component that will render the calendar.
// 2--Create a state variable to store the current date and another one to store the selected date.
// 3--In the component's render method, use JavaScript's built-in Date object to generate the calendar's dates. You can also use CSS to style the calendar and make it visually appealing.
// 4--Add event handlers for selecting a date and changing the current month.
// 5--Test your calendar to make sure it works as expected.
// Here's a basic example to get started:

import React, { useState } from "react";

const Calendar = () => {
  const [currentDate, setCurrentDate] = useState(new Date());
  const [selectedDate, setSelectedDate] = useState(null);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{currentDate.toDateString()}</h2>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Sun</th>
            <th>Mon</th>
            <th>Tue</th>
            <th>Wed</th>
            <th>Thu</th>
            <th>Fri</th>
            <th>Sat</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>{/* Generate the calendar's dates */}</tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Calendar;
// Note that this is just a basic example to get you started. You can further customize and improve the calendar by adding features like navigating between months, highlighting today's date, etc.
